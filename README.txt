Test for file commit

This was a project assigned by Krishna Mahavadi for her Summer 2019 CS313(Data Structures)
class. In this project, I had to build a program that was able to read Infix Expressions
and then convert them to Postfix and Prefix Expressions. I also had to evaluate the expressions
mathematically and I was also supposed to use the the Swing library of Java to draw a
Binary Expression Tree using the expression inputed by the user.

This is what I submitted.
